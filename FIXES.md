## Issue: React `asChild` Prop Error

### Problem
React was throwing the error:
```
React does not recognize the `asChild` prop on a DOM element.
```

This happened because we were using the `asChild` pattern from Radix UI, but without actually installing Radix UI. The `asChild` prop was being passed directly to DOM elements like `<button>` and `<a>`, which React doesn't recognize.

### Solution
Created a separate `ButtonLink` component specifically for anchor tags:

**Before:**
```tsx
<Button asChild>
  <a href="...">Click me</a>
</Button>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<ButtonLink href="...">Click me</ButtonLink>
```

### Files Modified

1. **components/ui/button.tsx**
   - Removed `asChild` prop from `ButtonProps`
   - Created new `ButtonLink` component for `<a>` tags
   - Exported both `Button` and `ButtonLink`

2. **components/layout/Header.tsx**
   - Replaced all `Button asChild` with `ButtonLink`
   - Updated social media icons
   - Fixed mobile menu icons

3. **components/layout/Footer.tsx**
   - Replaced all `Button asChild` with `ButtonLink`
   - Updated social media icons

4. **components/sections/HeroSection.tsx**
   - Replaced CTA buttons with `ButtonLink`
   - "View Projects" and "Download Resume" buttons

5. **components/sections/ProjectsSection.tsx**
   - Replaced all project links with `ButtonLink`
   - Featured project buttons
   - Project grid buttons

6. **components/sections/ContactSection.tsx**
   - Replaced "Get In Touch" button with `ButtonLink`

### Result
âœ… No more React warnings
âœ… All buttons and links work correctly
âœ… Maintains the same styling and behavior
âœ… TypeScript type-safe

### Testing
The site is now running without errors at:
- http://localhost:3000

All links and buttons are functional with proper styling.

## Additional Notes

If you want to add Radix UI properly in the future for more complex components, you can install it:

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-slot
```

Then implement the Slot pattern in the Button component:

```tsx
import { Slot } from "@radix-ui/react-slot";

const Button = ({ asChild, ...props }) => {
  const Comp = asChild ? Slot : "button";
  return <Comp {...props} />;
};
```

But for this portfolio, the `ButtonLink` approach is simpler and works perfectly.
